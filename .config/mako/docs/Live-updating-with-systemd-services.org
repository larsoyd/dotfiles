If you just installed mako and are changing config file rapidly and manually
running ~makoctl reload~ and some test ~notify-send~ command here is an example of
how to automate that process.

Create =~/.config/mako/reload.sh= script, that will also send you test
notification:

#+begin_src bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

makoctl reload
# to test a 'high' urgency notification add '-u critical '
notify-send -a "Test notif app" -i firefox -t 5000 "Here is some summary" "needed to <s>create</s> that script cuz /usr/bin/makoctl reload wasn't working and was preventing the notification to appear with no logs"
#+end_src

Create watcher service and don't forget to alter the path to the script in
ExecStart param:

#+begin_src
# ~/.config/systemd/user/mako-watcher.service

[Unit]
Description=mako notifications tester

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/path/to/.config/mako/reload.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
#+end_src

Create a .path service, that you will also need to start. Watcher won't work
without it. Also edit /PathModified/ param to match your full path to mako folder.

#+begin_src
# ~/.config/systemd/user/mako-watcher.path

[Path]
PathModified=%h/.config/mako/config

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
#+end_src

Enable those 2 user services:

#+begin_src
systemctl --user enable --now mako-watcher.service
systemctl --user enable --now mako-watcher.path
#+end_src

Now whenever you edit any file in =~/.config/mako= mako will reload its config and
send you a test notification.
